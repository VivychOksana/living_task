                </span>
                <p>
                    <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. 
                    I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated,
                    a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
                </p>
                <span>
                    How I turned things around
                </span>
                <p>
                    <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage,
                    sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't easy at all,
                    but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do.
                    And it worked.
                </p>
                <span>
                      Now I live the simple life
                </span>
                <p>
                    Now that I'm living a simple life,
                    things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more,
                    and I have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With how much it turned my life around,
                    <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>,
                    and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
